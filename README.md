### meetup_presentations
Repo to hold the presentations made by Pitt Fagan at various meetups/conferences.

All presentations will be in their own folder, organized by date, and an any ancillary material.

* **201704_PySpark** - The presentation showed how one could use Jupyter notebooks to run code on a Spark Cluster interactively using PySpark, and why this would be a great choice for a data scientist working with large datasets to leverage the cluster computing platform known as Apache Spark.

* **201610_RealWorldBigData** - This presentation was aimed at a non-technical audience and went over many examples of where Big Data and Data Science technologies are impacting the world in surprising ways.
